Multilevel modeling of metabolomics data

Project title : Multilevel pharmacokinetics-driven modeling of metabolomics data

Objective: Introduction of the concept of multilevel modelling for large-sample, unbalanced and unadjusted metabolomics data comprising nucleoside 
and creatinine concentration measurements in urine of healthy and cancer patients.

Conclusions: Bayesian multilevel modeling in metabolomics 
may be useful in understanding the data and may constitute a new tool for searching towards potential candidates of disease indicators.
